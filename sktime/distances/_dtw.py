        ----------
        x: np.ndarray (2d array of shape dxm1).

        window: Float, defaults = None
            Float that is the radius of the sakoe chiba window (if using Sakoe-Chiba
            lower bounding). Must be between 0 and 1.
        itakura_max_slope: float, defaults = None

            Custom bounding matrix to use. If defined then other lower_bounding params
            are ignored. The matrix should be structure so that indexes considered in
            bound should be the value 0. and indexes outside the bounding matrix should

        Raises

        ValueError
            If the input time series is not a numpy array.
            If the input time series doesn't have exactly 2 dimensions.
            If the sakoe_chiba_window_radius is not an integer.
